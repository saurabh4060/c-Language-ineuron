1. Write a C program to print Hello Students on the screen.
ANS-
#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
    printf("Hello students");
}


2. Write a C Program to print Hello on the first line and Students in the second line.
ANS- 
#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
    printf("Hello\nStudents");
}

3. Write a C program to print “MySirG” on the screen
ANS- 

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
    printf("\"MySirG\"");
}

4. Write a C program to print “Teacher’s Day” on the screen
ANS-

main()
{
    printf("\"Teacher's Day\"");
}


5. Write a C program to print \n on the screen
ANS- 

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
    printf("\\n");
}


6. Write a C program to print %d on the screen
ANS-

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
  printf("%%d");
}


7. Write a C program containing declaration of three variables (of type int, char and
float), also assign some values to them and print values of all three variables using
single printf().

ANS-

#include<stdio.h>
int a=5;
float b=5.5;
char c='B';
main()
{
    printf("%d %f %c",a,b,c);
}



8. Explore following format specifiers on internet - %i, %g, %lf

ANS-
1) The format specifier %i takes integer value as an integer value which means values should be decimal
2)The %g specifier displays the output same as the input with a same precision
3)For printf , arguments of type float are promoted to double so both %f and %lf are used for double 

9. Write a C program to print character stored in a char variable, also print its ASCII
code.
